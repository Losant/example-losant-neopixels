# Example: Control NeoPixels Using Losant

Here is an example setup for controlling
[Adafruit NeoPixels](https://www.adafruit.com/category/168) connected to an [Arduino 101](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Arduino101)
with a WiFi shield. Using [Losant](https://www.losant.com) commands, we can
change the color of individual pixels and report
their color state back to the platform.

This example was written for the Losant blog.
